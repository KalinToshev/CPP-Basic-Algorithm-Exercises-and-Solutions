# C++ Basic Algorithm Exercises and Solutions

This repository contains solutions to 129 C++ basic algorithm exercises, each stored in a separate .cpp file. The problems are sourced from the [C++ Basic Algorithm Exercises](https://www.w3resource.com/cpp-exercises/basic-algorithm/index.php) on w3resource.com.

## Structure

- Each exercise is stored in a separate .cpp file, named `exercise1.cpp`, `exercise2.cpp`, and so on.
- Each file contains the problem statement as a comment at the top and the solution below it.
